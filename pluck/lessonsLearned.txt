If I try to key an object using bracket notation:
object['key']
It will not work if key is wrapped in a parenthesis (unless the literal key is
the string 'key'). I was making the mistake of trying to key the object with the
string 'name' instead of the name variable.

What I still do not understand, which I am going to find out about on
Stackoverflow, is when I attempted to key the object with dot notation it did
not work:
object.key
Returned undefined

According to The Pragmatic Programmers CofeeScript book, dot notation should be
used specifically for properties. Bracket notation should be used for dynamic
variable keying or generation, like in the Pluck.coffee challenge that I just
solved.
