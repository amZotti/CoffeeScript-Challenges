As simple as this appears it is actually decievingly powerful. This simple 2
line function would require you to stack a filter method onto a map method in
ordinary Javascript. It is a huge time saver. On top of that, it reads just like
English, which is highly refreshing.

When using lift comprehensions in CoffeeScript, you need to use the 'when'
keyword in order filter the list. When acts the same way an if statement would
accept it is used in list comprehensions.

My favorite thing about CoffeeScript so far is the replacement of gruesome
comparison operators with their English equivalants:

JS operator  CoffeeScript operator
   ==               is
  !=                isnt
   !                not (unary)
