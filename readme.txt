I love Python, Ruby, and Javascript. For the longest time I couldn't decide between the 3 of them. I knew all of them had strong points and different purposes, but syntactically I was torn. But now, there exist: CoffeeScript.

CoffeeScript is the combination of Python and Ruby, baked into the Javascript engine.

Everything in CoffeeScript seems more intuitive already, I do not need to learn semantics at this point. The reason I am doing these challenges is for syntactic training. After that I am going to try to implement my next branch on mudConnector using CoffeeScript.
