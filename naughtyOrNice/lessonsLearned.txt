I am absolutely amazed at the power of CoffeeScript. At first I wasn’t sure if it was worth learning, both because of the time it would take to learn and also because I was worried that learning CoffeeScript would dilute my current skill base.

My concerns were warranted, but I was dead wrong. CoffeeScript is so effective that is saves time. Even more importantly than the increased productively is the degree of fun which coffee script provides.

CoffeeScript will not dilute my skills, if anything learning this will enhance my skills because as I learn the nuances of CoffeeScript it will bring more attention to elements of Javascript that I never noticed or paid attention to
before.

At the end of the day, if I am ever really worried about losing skill, there is only one true cure all for that: Action. Action combined with being in a alert and calm mental attitude is the cure all to anything. If I am really worried about losing skill or deviating too much, the real solution is massive action and alertness. Besides, the great thing about computer science as a field is everything is interrelated with everything else. It’s okay to go off and dabble in different things because by learning about the hard, you also learn about the soft.
